xxx Parse input:


x Look for quote marks;

x If there's nothing between them and something's near them - throw them;

!!! ec""ho	or	""echo	or	echo""	or	e"ch"o	-	are valid cases !!!

!!! "" echo	-	is not a valid case, appropriate message: "minishell: permission denied: ",
	because it tries to execute NULL !!!

x Save cmd, argument and/or flag to the struct.

x Check if command has a defined path (./	or	../some_folder),
	if not - it's a global one and you need to find a path in environment;

x Check for pipes (and redirections???) == Define number of commands
